            <h1>Adam Cardenas</h1>
            <h4>(Web Developer)</h4>
            <p>Hello my name is Adam Marc Cardenas, and I would like to thank you for your interest in me as a potential employee in your business or small venture. My skills in webdesign include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Out of all these three I am very proud in my work in CSS, not only that I am also a quick and motivated learner who's always perfecting his skills. I have used these skills to create innovative and creative projects as you wil see from my examples listed below.</p>
            <p>Here is my resume: <a target="_blank" href="./Files/AC Resume.pdf">AC Resume.pdf</a></p>

            <h3>Irregular Table</h3>
            <p>This was one of the first HTML projects I worked on and while it is a simple piece, it allowed to learn how to control the scale of objects when it comes to charts such as this. It showed me how through web design I could achieve brilliant and abstract works which I hope to continue work with in the future.</p>

            <h3>Audio-Video</h3>
            <p>In this assigntment I experimented with adding different forms of media into a site including songs and videos. This was a very entertaining endeavor since I used some of my favorite songs including "I want you back" by the Jackson 5 and "I'm still Standing" by Elton John, I also took the liberty of using a video that was not assigned to be included specifically a clip from "Fresh prince of Bel-air" where Will walks in on his mother in bed with his future father-in-law. I hope to further develop my skills in media in the near future.</p>

            <h3>Grid Display</h3>
            <p>In this project I got to learn how to create the basic format of a website using simple width calculations, specifically the margins to the right of each box (1% - 4px). My skills for formatting grid systems have improved since but I included this version of the assignment to show how it was originally.</p>

            <h3>Header Project</h3>
            <p>This project I'll admit I went above and beyond in regards to content. The assignment was to only create a basic header, which I did with reactive buttons (done with CSS not JavaScript) in a sleek style using the issued color palettes, but I wanted to show how the header would in a site with content on it. </p>

            <h3>Basic Webpage</h3>
            <p>For this assignment I was tasked with creating an actual web page which had to be similar to a blog, so for this I took my previous header project and improved upon it using float elements to create a sidebar and creating a footer element containing fake information sections and a copyright bar at the very bottom. It was my first professional looking webpage that I created.</p>

            <h3>Fixed Sidebar</h3>
            <p>There is not much to say about this project, I simply wrote a webpage with a basic fixed sidebar that did not move no matter how much content was on the screen or how much the viewer needed to scroll. Although it did introduce me to the flex-basis concept which has helped me expand my horizons in regards to website formatting.</p>

            <h3>Media Query Webpage</h3>
            <p>With this assignment I worked with media querries for the first time, the content were blank but the outcome was the same nonetheless. To me the best part about Media querries is reshaping the site so that way it can be viewed across any device, this was done using flex elements as you can see in the images below where the boxes on the page shift from being stacked next to each other to being stacked on top of each other depending on the screen size.</p>

            <h3>Mockup Webpage</h3>
            <p>This has to be my greatest and proudest work as of yet, the goal was to recreate a previously existing webpage format solely from an image of the site we were presented including the logos, text, background images, reactive buttons, and other items. Now the point of the assignment was to only recreate the format of the webpage, so there isn't any JavaScript in the page but other than it is a dead wringer to the original photo.</p>
